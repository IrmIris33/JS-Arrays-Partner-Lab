# JS Arrays Partner Lab

## Description
You will pair program with a partner to complete this assignemnt. One partner, the driver, should share their screen and be the one typing. The other partner, the observer, should review each line of code. Both partners should be cooperating when solving problems. When an objective has been met, the driver should push the code to the GitHub account, the observer should pull the changes, and the two partners switch roles. 

## Part One

1. Given an array `myArray`, determine if it is empty.
2. Given an array `myArray` and a string `value`, overwrite all the values in the array with the string.
3. Given two arrays `alpha` and `beta`, determine if the two arrays are equal.


## Part Two

1. Given an array `myArray` and a string `value`, add the string to the array.
2. Given an array `myArray`, a string `value`, and a number `n`, fill the array with n values.

&emsp; &emsp; Ex. 

&emsp; &emsp; Input: "Kaleb", 3

&emsp; &emsp; Output: ["Kaleb", "Kaleb", "Kaleb"];

3. Given an array `myArray`, create a dublicate array containing all the values in `myArray`.

## Part Three

1. Given an array `myArray`, a number `start`, and a number `stop`, create a new array containing all the values in `myArray` between `start` and `stop`.

2. Given an array `myArray`, reverse the ordering of its elements;

3. Given an array `myArray` and a number `value`, find the index of the first occurance of `value` in `myArray`.

***Happy Hacking!***
